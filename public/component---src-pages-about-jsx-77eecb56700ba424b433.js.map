I'm a singer-songwriter, instrumentalist and producer of music. I\r\n          started my musical journey over fifteen years ago with a little old guitar and a love of making sounds with\r\n          it. <br /><br /> Later, in my teens I began hopping freight trains and hitch-hiking around the country -\r\n          mostly enjoying the wide-open expanses of the western U.S.. Busking on street corners and farmers' markets was\r\n          my preferred method of getting myself fed. <br /><br />I am taking a leap and am producing my first full album\r\n          (name yet to be determined). It's such an exciting endeavor and I have so many folks to thank for my desicion\r\n          and for thier support so far. <br /><br />If you are curious to find out more, follow this journey and/or\r\n          connect and support the process, I urge you to hop on over to my <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Cambomusic\"\r\n            aria-label=\"Link to Patreon Page\">Patreon</a> - the home base for this project.</p>\r\n        <h4>Keep On Keepin' On</h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n</>\r\n\r\n)"],"sourceRoot":""}
