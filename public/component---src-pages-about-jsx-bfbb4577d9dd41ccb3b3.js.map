I'm a singer-songwriter, instrumentalist and producer of music. I started my musical journey over fifteen years ago with a little old guitar and a love of making sounds with it. <br/><br/> Later, in my teens I began hopping freight trains and hitch-hiking around the country - mostly enjoying the wide-open expanses of the western U.S.. Busking on street corners and farmers' markets was my preferred method of getting myself fed. <br/><br/>I am taking a leap and am producing my first full album (name yet to be determined). It's such an exciting endeavor and I have so many folks to thank for my desicion and for thier support so far. <br/><br/>If you are curious to find out more, follow this journey and/or connect and support the process, I urge you to hop on over to my <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Cambomusic\" aria-label=\"Link to Patreon Page\">Patreon</a> - the home base for this project.</p>\r\n      <h4>Keep On Keepin' On</h4>\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  </div>\r\n</>\r\n  \r\n)\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
