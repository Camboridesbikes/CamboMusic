        <p>My name is <strong>Felix Cambo</strong>. I'm a singer-songwriter, instrumentalist and producer of music. I
          started my musical journey over fifteen years ago with a little old guitar and a love of making sounds with
          it. <br /><br /> Later, in my teens I began hopping freight trains and hitch-hiking around the country -
          mostly enjoying the wide-open expanses of the western U.S.. Busking on street corners and farmers' markets was
          my preferred method of getting myself fed. <br /><br />I am taking a leap and am producing my first full album
          (name yet to be determined). It's such an exciting endeavor and I have so many folks to thank for my decision
          and for their support so far. <br /><br />If you are curious to find out more, follow this journey and/or
          connect and support the process, I urge you to hop on over to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Cambomusic"
