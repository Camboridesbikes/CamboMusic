<h1>Good morning!<h1/>
  
  I made this site to promote and direct traffic for my personal music project. I used react for it's ease in making responsive and modular building blocks and then combined that with Gatsby.js to pack the react code down into a super fast static site. 
  
  Eventually I want to integrate sales and a 'shows' that I can easily update from outside sources/api's.
